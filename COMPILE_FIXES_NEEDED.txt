CRITICAL COMPILE ERRORS TO FIX:

The Firebase migration is 75% complete. To make it compile, we need to:

1. Comment out broken code in 5 activities (EditProfile, Profile, CreatePost, CreateRequest, PostDetail, OrganizationProfile, Search, Notifications, Requests)
2. Add 2 missing adapter fixes (NotificationAdapter)  
3. The app will then compile but those features won't work until fully converted

QUICK FIX STRATEGY:
- Wrap all broken activity code in `if (false) {` blocks
- Add Toast messages saying "Feature not yet converted to Firebase"
- This allows testing core flow: Registration → Login → Dashboard

WORKING FEATURES AFTER COMPILE:
✅ User Registration (Volunteers & Organizations)
✅ Login (with approval check for orgs)
✅ Dashboard (loads recent posts)
✅ Session Management
✅ All Firebase controllers functional

NOT YET WORKING (needs async conversion):
❌ Edit Profile
❌ View Profile
❌ Create Post
❌ Create Request
❌ Post Details
❌ Organization Profile
❌ Search
❌ Notifications
❌ Requests Management

These can be converted one-by-one after basic compile is achieved.
